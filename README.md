# User experience
### First Time Visitor Goals
As a First Time User, I want to explore the game. I can see at the very beginning, the game is called Magical Door and it interacts with me with written sentences on the screen.
As a First Time User, I want to understand how to play the game. After typing in my name, the game interacts with my name which is good to address the player during the game, and gives me options to choose upon how I wish to play the game. I know exactly what is expected of me, what I need to do to get the treasure in this game, and how I can navigate through it.
As a First Time User, I will get an experience of what to expect with the options chosen. The game also explains what they could experience with the options they have chosen.
As a First Time User, I want feedback on whether I have chosen the best option to stay in the game and to navigate through different stages or section. The game communicates with me at every stage and explains me what is on the route.  
As a First Time User, I want to know how to become a winner and navigate through each section to become a winner at the end and to get the treasure of the game Magical door.
As a First Time User, I want to be communicated with the progress I made at every stage of the game, it tells me if I have cleared the stage and gives me an appropriate message for each occasion. I want to know, if I have lost or won the game.

# How to play
The player will be greeted with a message “welcome to Magical Door Game”. The game prompts the player to enter his/her name.  A player starts to play Magical door by typing their name and they will be greeted and given two options to proceed with the game, Yes or No.

- The game won’t proceed if the player chooses the option “No”.

- If the player agrees to play by typing “Yes”, it gives further two options to select a path, Right or left.

- If the player chooses, “Right”,

- The path to the “Right” will lead to enchanted forest and gives some more descriptions. It asks the player whether the Mantras chanted are 1. Divine or 2.Mundane. If they choose Mundane, they lose the game.

- If they choose, Divine, they will proceed to next level, which will open the portal to enter the new magical world with full of magical creatures.

- The game gives further two options to choose between red or white dragon to take a ride to magical road. If the choose White Dragon, they are out of the game.

- If they choose Red Dragon, it will take the player across seven mountains and seven seas. One of the seven seas has a beautiful giant fish with glittering gold scales which hold the key for magical door. They player will be given seven options, such as numbers 1 to 7 and the odd numbers will get a key, which needs to be charged to proceed to next level. If they choose even numbers, they lose the game.

- The magical door has sharp wooden fence. The player needs to burn the fence and also needs to charge it with fire. The player is now given options to choose between, Dragon’s fire or match box.

- If the player choose, Match box they will lose the game. If they choose, dragon fire they can burn the fence and also charge the key.

- As the key is charged, they player can open the door and will get the options to choose from Gold, Diamond and Platinum as a treasure.

- The player can choose their desired treasure as their prize.

- If the player chooses, “Left”,

- The path to the “Left” will lead to a river and they play need to choose between the options to swim or walk around.

- If they choose to walk around, they will be left with no water and food, so eventually they will die.

- If they choose to swim, they will be eaten by Aligator.

- This means, the path to the “Left” is not the road to win the treasure.
